# MeteoriumJDA
This is basically [Meteorium](https://github.com/RealEthanPlayzDev/Meteorium) but written in Java instead and uses [Java Discord API (JDA)](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA).

## Compiling
You need atleast minimal JDK 17 to compile this. I used IntelliJ IDEA when creating the project so I do not know if this is cross compatible with other IDEs. (example: Eclipse)
